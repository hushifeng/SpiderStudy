A map of XX Systems built by everyone of us

We know our systems are not like these islands,
even though we wish they were so simply decoupled and so easy to deal with

We sense our systems are probably like this,
even though we wish they were not that bad

With our brains structured this way, we tend to believe our systems can be similarly modelled 
and we as humans are also connected the same way

We would like to enable a web site where a single map of all XX systems can be drawn by anyone of us,
piece by piece
day by day
always up to date!
